# INSTRUCTIONS TO REPRODUCE FIGURES
- In order to reproduce Figures 1 to 13 in the Markov part of the report, put function `initialize1.m` in folder Markov and change its name to `initialize.m` (it will replace the already existing function `initialize.m`). Then run the script `MarkovRun.m` in the same folder (competing strategies: GEN-3 vs SET-3 vs Tit-for-Tat, N=6).
- In order to reproduce Figures 14 to 25 in the Markov part of the report, put function `initialize2.m` in folder Markov and change its name to `initialize.m` (it will replace the already existing function `initialize.m`). Then run the script `MarkovRun.m` in the same folder (competing strategies: GEN-3 vs SET-3 vs Tit-for-Tat, N=9).
- In order to reproduce Figures 26 to 28 in the Markov part of the report, put function `initialize3.m` in folder Markov and change its name to `initialize.m` (it will replace the already existing function `initialize.m`). Then run the script `MarkovRun.m` in the same folder (competing strategies: All-C vs All-D vs Tit-for-Tat, N=9).
